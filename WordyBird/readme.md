- My submission for this challenge:

- The game text says 128KB but the load time was too long so skipped to 64K
- Note the text file is flipped in 3d around the origin top left

A proof of technology rather than a game - I still need to upload (maybe):
- The original core loop = 15 lines of basic for a playable game
- The version including lines that created the original level

# Update
I "won"!
