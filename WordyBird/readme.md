- My submission for this challenge:  
https://olimex.wordpress.com/2023/05/05/agonlight-weekend-programming-challenge-issue-2/
- A proof of technology rather than a game
- The game text says 128KB but the load time was too long so skipped to 64K
- Change line 155 up to &AFF00 for the full-length experience, and line 550 for hardcore mode 

# Update
- I "won"- YouTube news report https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VNhshYAGQ0- 

## To run
- Download WB.BBC and WBL.TXT to SD Card

        CHAIN "WB"

## Todo  (maybe):
- Upload the original core loop = 15 lines of basic for a playable game
- The version including lines that created the  level in memory
